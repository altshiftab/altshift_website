                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p>Currently, Alt-Shift is just me, Viktor. I founded Alt-Shift in 2022, after I had worked with larger consulting companies for several years and wanted to have more of a decision about the types of projects to work on.</p>
                <p>My two greatest interests are cybersecurity and programming; cybersecurity because of the ingenuity involved, and programming because it gives me great satisfaction to architect and implement solutions and see them solve real problems.</p>
                <p>Aside from engaging in either of my two greatest interests, you might in my spare time find me pulling off Caro-Kann openings or contemplating prehistory at the gym.</p>
